# Weather-App-Angular
An angular 1.6 weather application using nodejs for the API and Dark Sky for the API. 

Wanted to bundle this and a web server into npm start but did not have time. I would have bundled all css/js into two files as well.


Install/Run Commands

$ npm install 

$ npm install http-server -g

$ npm start

Then open another cmd/terminal window, navigate to the project folder then...

$ http-server
