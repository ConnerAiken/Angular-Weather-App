# Weather-App-Angular
An angular 1.6 weather application using SLIM framework for the API and Dark Sky for the API.

The application uses webpack for bundling and bower for the front-end components.

List of installs/commands to get app running.. Wanted to bundle this and a web server into npm but did not have time. I would have bundled all css/js into two files and configured just 'npm install' and 'npm start'. Only had 48 hours to complete this unfortunately..


Install/Run Commands

$ npm install 

$ npm install http-server -g

$ npm start

Then open another cmd/terminal window, navigate to the project folder then...

$ http-server -a localhost -p 8000
